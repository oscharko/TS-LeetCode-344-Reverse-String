## 344. Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Example 1:
- Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
- Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## Example 2:
- Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
- Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.
